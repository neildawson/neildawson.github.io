# {{ page.short_description }}

I've been making stuff for the web for a couple of decades now.

My pal [Rupert has a lovely "museum" of his older web design work](https://rupertsliwa.com/museum_of_web_design.html), so I thought it would be fun to make a similar retrospective of mine!

# Metal Gear Solid: Shadow Moses

First I have to acknowledge the demise of one of my earliest creations. This [videogame franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear) fansite was built on [Moonfruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonfruit), a flash-based WYSIWYG website design tool, so is lost to the mists of time.

I have no screenshots of it. But I do remember refreshing the page repeatedly to drive up my visitor count.
