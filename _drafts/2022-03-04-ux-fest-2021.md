Last year my colleague [Rupert](https://rupertsliwa.com) and I attended [UX Fest](https://2021.uxlondon.com/), the virtual incarnation of [UX London](https://uxlondon.com/).

I hadn't been to a conference in years, and I was reminded how invigorating it is to see so many different perspectives and approaches in a short time.

We put together [a wee presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/neildawson/ux-fest-2021/) to share what we learned with other folk at TotallyMoney. I made a similar summary for UX London 2013 and it really helped cement the concepts in my head.

The standout for me was [Teresa Torres](https://www.producttalk.org/)' talk on continuous discovery, which inspired me to kick off weekly customer interviews at TotallyMoney.

I really appreciated
