Like most, I have hundreds of digital photographs in my library, rarely seen. In 2016 I set out to make a physical record of my year, not just in photographs, but also in the books, games, shows, exhibitions, and other experiences I had.

So far I've printed yearbooks for 2016 to 2020. 2021 is mostly done, but I haven't thought of a nice cover yetâ€¦
