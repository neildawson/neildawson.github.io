![2016 and 2017 yearbooks]({{ "/assets/yearbooks/hero.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Like most, I have hundreds of digital photographs in my library, rarely seen. In 2016 I set out to make a physical record of my year, not just in photographs, but also in the books, games, shows, exhibitions, and other experiences I had.

So far I've completed yearbooks for 2016 and 2017, with 2018 in progress.
