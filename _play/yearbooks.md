Like most, I have hundreds of digital photographs in my library, rarely seen. In 2016 I set out to make a physical record of my year, not just in photographs, but also recording books, games, shows, exhibitions, and other experiences I had.

So far I've printed six yearbooks covering 2016 to 2021, with 2022 on the way.
