During the first lockdown I received a surprise delivery from a friend: a box of small plastic figures, some paints, and a brush.

It was the perfect way to pass time while we were all stuck inside. Quiet, hands-on, creative, and away from a screen.

Since that first box I've enjoyed collecting, building, and painting more miniatures, reading tie-in novels, and playing tabletop games with friends.

Here are a few selections from [my mini painting Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/archaeovist/).
