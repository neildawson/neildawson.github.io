description: "A responsive glossary in HTML and CSS"

[Star Citizen](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/) is a multiplayer space simulation game on a grand scale, in development for PC.

I coded and wrote [a responsive glossary](../scglossary) to make sense of all the terminology, and to explore some CSS features I hadnâ€™t played with yet, like transforms, animations, and pseudo elements. Try visiting on a few devices to see how the page changes to suit device width.
