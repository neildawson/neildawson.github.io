description: "Quick reference control diagram for new players"
---

I organised a Mario Kart party at work and designed this control diagram to lower the barrier to entry, helping new players get involved. I printed it out at A2 size and stuck it above the telly so it was easy to consult while playing.

It's intended to be a quick reference, easily read from a distance, using conversational language rather than jargon only gamers would understand.

[Download the PDF](../../assets/mariokart/Mario%20Kart%208%20Controls.pdf) and print it out for your pals.
