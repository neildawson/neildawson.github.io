In 2013 I took 10,000 photographs on a tour of Iran.

In 2023 I marked the anniversary by recounting the trip one photo at a time, each shared 10 years since the day it was taken. I accompanied them with words, sometimes from memory, sometimes from emails written in Iran and sent to my parents. It was surprisingly emotional!

I'd also like to flesh this out into a photobook to share with my friends and family.

Here are a few of my favourite photos:

## Why Iran?

In the 70s my Granpa accepted a role as head teacher of the British School in Tehran, capital city of Iran. Thus began a great adventure for the whole family: exploring the sights of ancient Persia, learning to ski in the Alborz mountains, meeting the Queen Mother, and an epic 3,700 mile journey from Tehran to Edinburgh in a [Paykan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paykan).

In 2008 my classmates Jo, Lee, Natalie, and I based our student project  on my relationship with my Granpa and his relationship with Iran. We designed a pair of complementary objects which would allow him to share his stories and photographs, which were usually locked away in slides. [We presented _Storymaker, Storyteller_ at the Microsoft Design Expo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykZpcLoDF8w) in Redmond, Washington.

In 2013 I joined some family friends on their annual tour to complete the number one item on my bucket list, finally see the country for myself, and take some photos of my own.
