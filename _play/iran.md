In 2013 I took 10,000 photographs on a tour of Iran.

A mere six years on, I've sorted through all the photos, dug out my daily emails to my parents, scanned all the paraphernalia I brought home, and I'm working to condense it all into a book I can share with my friends and family.

It's a work in progress. Here are a few of my favourite photos in the meantime:

## Why Iran?

In the 70s my Granpa accepted a role as head teacher of the British School in Tehran, capital city of Iran. Thus began a great adventure for the whole family: exploring the sights of ancient Persia, learning to ski in the Alborz mountains, meeting the Queen Mother, and an epic 3,700 mile journey from Tehran to Edinburgh in a [Paykan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paykan).

In 2008 my classmates Jo, Lee, Natalie, and I based our student project  on my relationship with my Granpa and his relationship with Iran. We designed a pair of complementary objects which would allow him to share his stories and photographs, which were usually locked away in slides. We presented _Storymaker, Storyteller_ at the Microsoft Design Expo in Redmond, Washington.

In 2013 I joined Harry and Maureen, friends of my grandparents, on one of their annual tours of Iran to complete the number one item on my bucket list, finally see the country for myself, and take some photos of my own.
