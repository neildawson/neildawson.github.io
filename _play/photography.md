I was first encouraged to pick up a camera by my art teachers, Mr Walker and Mr Wotherspoon, in 2005. It used a floppy disk as a memory card!

These days I'm mostly content to capture memories for my [yearbooks]({% link _play/yearbooks.md %}) on my smartphone, but I occasionally pull out the DSLR and tripod for [travel]({% link _play/iran.md %}), portrait, and [miniature photography]({% link _play/minipainting.md %}). I've even shot a few weddings in my time.

Here are some of my favourites.
