title: "UX Companion"

description: "A handy glossary of user experience theories, tools, and principles"
introduction: >
 At Cyber-Duck, we were looking for a simple app idea to get our teeth into iOS development.
 
 
 I'd been putting together a list of industry jargon and design principles (inspired by [Universal Principles of Design](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Universal-Principles-Design-Usability-Perception/dp/1592530079)) which I proposed we develop into a resource for other creatives.
 
 
 [UX Companion is available for iOS and Android](https://www.uxcompanion.com/).
responsibilities:
  - "Proposal and concept"
  - "Curation, writing, and editing"
  - "User journey"
results:
  - "Over 50,000 downloads from more than 100 countries"

## A simple start

I drew up a list of topics from classic design principles like the 80/20 rule, web design concepts like progressive enhancement, and UCD tools and terminology like mental models.

The target audience was digital creatives looking to expand their knowledge. I also sought to give clients who had commissioned digital work a basis for understanding the industry and its practices.

Topics can be browsed from the searchable index view, and each topic has a one-line summary, a short description, and a few resources for further reading. I hand-picked every resource to ensure a range of media and complexity.

## UX Companion today

We launched UX Companion for iOS in 2014, and if memory serves we had only 20 articles, all written by me!

Though the articles are short, it took a lot of time to get them to that state. After the first batch we brought in copywriters to accelerate the update process. I oversaw and edited their work before it went live.

We launched on Android in early 2015.

Since my departure from Cyber-Duck in late 2015 the team have continued to develop the app with a redesign, an expanded library of almost 100 topics, and an Amazon Alexa Skill.
