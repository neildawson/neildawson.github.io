<p>Very important facts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>As you can probably tell, I enjoy ordering, categorising, and recording things.</li>
	<li>I call myself <em>TerminalVeracity</em> online because it sounds like an <a href="https://theculture.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_spacecraft#Novels" target="_blank">Iain M. Banks spaceship</a>, and because I can't lie to save myself.</li>
	<!-- li>When I look straight up without moving my head, my eyes go squint.</li -->
	<li>I had a letter read out on the final episode of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_%26_Kicking" target="_blank"><em>Live & Kicking</em></a> hosted by Zoe Ball and Jamie Theakston.</li>
</ul>
